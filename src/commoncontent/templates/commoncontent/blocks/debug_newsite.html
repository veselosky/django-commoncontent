<div class="container-lg">
  <h1>Congratulations! You have a generic site!</h1>
  <p>
    You have installed django-commoncontent, but you apparently have not created a home
    page yet. To start, make sure you have created an admin user.
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    python manage.py createsuperuser
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Then <a href="{% url "admin:index" %}">log into the admin</a> and start creating pages!
  </p>
</div>
