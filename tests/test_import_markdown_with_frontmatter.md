## What is this \"shell\"?

The \"shell\" is another name for the command shell or command interpreter. This is the
program that gives you a command prompt, accepts the commands you type there, and
basically makes the computer do what you tell it to. In DOS the program that did this
was command.com (unless you were a real technogeek and used
[4dos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS) or something). In Linux, the shell is the
first program that starts when you log in, and it keeps running until you log out,
waiting to do your bidding. Linux is able to use any of several different shells, but
the default Linux shell is called bash and is the only one I will discuss.
